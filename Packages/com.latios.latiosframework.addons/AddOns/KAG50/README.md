# Kinemation Animation Graph 50

This is an experimental animation graph add-on for Kinemation. It is based on
<https://github.com/RandallLiuXin/DotsAnimation> which was a project that
borrowed from Latios Framework 0.5 and possibly DMotion targeting Entities 0.50
and did not survive the Entities 1.0 transition.

It has been updated to function on the latest version of the Latios Framework
proper, but has not been cleaned up beyond that.

## Getting Started

**Scripting Define:** LATIOS_ADDON_KAG50

**Requirements:**

-   Requires Latios Framework 0.11.5 or newer
-   Requires
    https://github.com/alelievr/NodeGraphProcessor.git?path=/Assets/com.alelievr.NodeGraphProcessor

**Main Author(s):** alelievr

**Additional Contributors:** Dreaming I’m Latios

**Support:** No support planned. This was an experiment, with the intent that
the community may adopt it if it seemed useful.

## Potential Improvements

Here are some next tasks for anyone who wants to try and improve it:

-   Replace Entities.ForEach with idiomatic foreach and IJobEntity
-   Switch to using ISystem
-   Fix sync point and Burst for parameters
-   Improve naming and namespaces to conform better with Latios Framework
    standards
-   Update root motion to use the new Kinemation root motion APIs
-   Update events to not copy FixedStrings everywhere
-   Add new node types (Blend trees, IK, ect)

## Original Description

This is a Unity DOTS animation solution. Though still in progress, it is already
capable for project usages. (Especially for now, unity doesn't have any official
animation solution with the latest DOTS package.)

-   Animation Graph: You can save all the animation variables on it. It supports
    using nodes to control the Skeleton bones and to define the character's
    final animation pose.
-   Animation State Machine: Provide a way to break animation of a character
    into a series of States. These states are then governed by Transition Rules
    that control how to blend from one state to another.
-   Animation State: It is a portion of an animation graph that we know the
    character will be blending into and out of on a regular basis. You can use
    different sample nodes and blend nodes to define the final animation pose
    for each Animation State.
-   Animation Transition: After you defined your states, you need to use
    Animation Transition to control how your character is going to transit from
    one state to another, including transition time, transition rules, how to
    blend, etc.
-   Animation Events
-   Root motion
-   Animation Compression: based on [ACL](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl)

### Example

You can find a sample graph here:

You can refer to SampleScene.scene for a test example.

### How to test

1.  Open SampleScene.scene and press play button.
2.  You can see three characters. The left one is driven by unity's original
    animator. The other two are this library test examples. The middle one is a
    single animation clip test. The right one is a animation graph test.

1.  Open DOTS hierarchy, and select RPG-Character_ecs_animationGraph

1.  In the Inspector windows, you can find Bool Parameter

1.  Set Moving value to true, you will see the character start to run. Set Dead
    value to true, you will see the character start to play stun animation.
    After finishing stun animation, the character will play knockdown animation.

1.  Looks like this

### How It Works

1.  AnimationGraphBlobberSystem: convert unity gameobject to dots entity
2.  AnimationSetParameterSystem: set all the animation parameter based on event
3.  AnimationGraphSystem
    1.  UpdateAnimationGraphNodeJob update animation nodes which in the graph
    2.  set animation state machine weight based on animation node result
4.  AnimationStateMachineSystem: init state machine and evaluate transition,
    then create new state if needed
5.  AnimationChangeStateSystem: handle change state event and blend pose during
    state transition
6.  UpdateAnimationNodesSystem: update all the animation states
7.  AnimationBlendWeightsSystem: calculate all animations blend weight
8.  ClipSamplingSystem
    1.  sample optimize skeleton
    2.  raise animation events
    3.  send animation event to other system
    4.  sample root delta
    5.  apply root motion to entity
